# Simple-Birthday-Card-on-Android-Studio-using-Kotlin

This is a simple Android interface on Android Studio. It was written in Kotlin language. You can modify whatever the background image you need and can edit all the text along with inclusion of additional lines to be seen on the birthday card too.
This was to run on pixel 7 and above. So, while trying to load, please select devices Pixel 7 or higher :)
